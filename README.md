**Bring Your Own Agent. We bring the platform.**

The AI agent world is messy. Teams reach for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or build from scratch. Good. That's the creative phase. But once an agent leaves a developer's laptop and starts talking to production data, calling external APIs, or running on shared infrastructure, freedom without guardrails stops being a feature and starts being a liability.

This repo is the companion to [Operationalizing "Bring Your Own Agent" on Red Hat AI, the OpenClaw edition](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/operationalizing-bring-your-own-agent-red-hat-ai-openclaw-edition). It takes [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), a personal AI assistant that routes agent interactions across channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord) through a central WebSocket gateway, and operationalizes it on Kubernetes with [Kagenti](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti-operator).

We aren't wrapping OpenClaw in a proprietary framework. We're wrapping it in platform infrastructure.

## The BYOA Principle

The platform is framework-agnostic. What matters is that the agent has identity, runs under least-privilege, gets observed, passes safety checks, and can be audited after the fact. The platform provides security, governance, observability, and lifecycle management. The agent stays yours.

OpenClaw doesn't sandbox by default. It doesn't enforce RBAC, trace tool calls, or gate access to external services. Kagenti and Red Hat AI add each of those layers without touching the agent's code.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanetworker/kagenti-claw.git
cd kagenti-claw
make deploy
```

One command. The output gives you your dashboard URL and gateway token.

Using Claude Code? Even simpler:

```bash
/deploy-openclaw
```

```

Three Kagenti primitives manage the agent's lifecycle:

| Primitive | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AgentRuntime** | Attaches to an existing Deployment or StatefulSet. Applies labels, config hashes, and tracks pod readiness. The agent code is untouched. |
| **AgentCard** | Discovers agent metadata via the A2A protocol. Supports HTTP fetch or ConfigMap-based injection for agents that don't natively serve `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. |
| **ConfigMap (agent card)** | A static A2A agent card injected as `{agentName}-card-signed`. The Kagenti `ConfigMapFetcher` reads this before trying HTTP. No sidecar or image rebuild needed. |

## After Deployment

Your cluster has a fully managed, discoverable AI agent:

```
$ kubectl get agentruntimes -n agents
NAME       TYPE    TARGET     PHASE    AGE
openclaw   agent   openclaw   Active   2m
```

```
$ kubectl get agentcards -n agents
NAME                       PROTOCOL   KIND         TARGET     VERIFIED   BOUND   SYNCED   AGE
openclaw-deployment-card   a2a        Deployment   openclaw                      True     2m
```

The AgentCard shows `SYNCED=True` because the operator found the `openclaw-card-signed` ConfigMap and loaded the A2A agent card schema from it. No HTTP endpoint was needed.

## How the AgentCard Gets Its Data

Agents that speak A2A natively serve `/.well-known/agent-card.json` over HTTP. OpenClaw doesn't. Instead of building a sidecar or adapter, we use the Kagenti operator's **ConfigMap fetcher**.

The `ConfigMapFetcher` in the Kagenti operator checks for a ConfigMap named `{agentName}-card-signed` with key `agent-card.json` in the agent's namespace **before** falling back to HTTP. This means:

1. **No image rebuild** — the agent image stays untouched
2. **No sidecar** — no extra container serving a static file
3. **No A2A adapter** — no protocol translation layer

You define the agent card as a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: openclaw-card-signed    # Must be {serviceName}-card-signed
  namespace: agents
data:
  agent-card.json: |
    {
      "name": "OpenClaw",
      "description": "Multi-channel AI gateway with extensible messaging integrations",
      "version": "2026.3.14",
      "url": "https://openclaw-agents.apps.your-cluster.com",
      "capabilities": { "streaming": true, "pushNotifications": false },
      "defaultInputModes": ["text/plain"],
      "defaultOutputModes": ["text/plain"],
      "skills": [
        { "name": "chat", "description": "Conversational AI agent" },
        { "name": "web-browsing", "description": "Browse and extract from web pages" },
        { "name": "code-execution", "description": "Execute code and return results" }
      ]
    }
```

Apply it, and the AgentCard CR syncs automatically. This pattern works for any non-A2A agent.

## The Platform Layers (from the blog)

This repo covers the deployment and discovery layer. The [blog series](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/operationalizing-bring-your-own-agent-red-hat-ai-openclaw-edition) covers the full stack:

| Layer | What it provides | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Isolation** | Sandboxed containers (Kata) for kernel-isolated agent sessions | Planned |
| **Identity** | SPIFFE/SPIRE workload identity, scoped service-account tokens | Planned (Kagenti) |
| **Lifecycle** | AgentRuntime + AgentCard CRDs for deploy, discover, observe | This repo |
| **Observability** | MLflow tracing (OTEL-compatible) for prompts, tool calls, token costs | Developer preview |
| **Safety** | Garak adversarial scanning, Guardrails Orchestrator, NeMo Guardrails | GA / Tech preview |
| **Tool governance** | MCP Gateway (Envoy-based) with identity-based tool filtering | Developer preview |
| **API surface** | OpenResponses-compatible runtime, vLLM chat completions | Available |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NAMESPACE` | `agents` | Where OpenClaw lands |
| `IMAGE` | `quay.io/aicatalyst/openclaw:latest` | The agent image |
| `KAGENTI_VERSION` | `0.2.0-alpha.22` | Kagenti operator chart version |

```bash
make deploy NAMESPACE=my-agents IMAGE=quay.io/aicatalyst/openclaw:20260320-d0ed2c3
```

## Makefile Targets

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make deploy` | Install operator + deploy OpenClaw + print credentials |
| `make teardown` | Remove everything cleanly |
| `make token` | Print the gateway token and dashboard URL |
| `make status` | Show pod, AgentRuntime, and AgentCard status |
| `make approve-pairing` | Approve pending dashboard device pairings |

## Claude Code Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/deploy-openclaw` | Full automated deployment: operator, manifests, route, token, pairing |
| `/setup-agentcard` | Generate and deploy an A2A agent card ConfigMap for any agent |

## Connecting to the Dashboard

After `make deploy`, open the printed dashboard URL. Paste the gateway token, click Connect, then run `make approve-pairing` to authorize the session.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (v1.28+) — OpenShift for Route support, or bring your own Ingress
- `kubectl` configured and connected
- `helm` v4+ (the Makefile installs the Kagenti operator for you)
